# outline-presentation-mode

I'm uploading this because the original website seems to be down. I had to get it via wayback-machine [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20160810000826/http://clandest.in/emacs.d/plain/outline-presentation.el).

I'm making a few changes like using the default modifier key, instead of the special `A-M` one which requires additional setup.
